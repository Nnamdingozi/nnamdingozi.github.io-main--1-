## Assessing servers

When runnning a code on a server eg amazon web services, you need to assess the server.The best way to do this is through Secure Shell(ssh), which lets you securely control and modify your server using the Internet. You can do this by typing the code below
 ## code for assessing server
 
 *ssh username@host_server*
 where username is the account name of your account on the server, and host_server is the host(eg GPU cluster name).
  if you hace a password to access your account on the server, command line will prompt you to enter that in.It may also ask you if it can remember the authenticity key.In this case type yes.
